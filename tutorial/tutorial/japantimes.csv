2023-02-28T19:16:00+09:00,Olivia Rudgard,The EU is cracking down on plastic. Will others follow?,"<p>When U.N. negotiations over a global agreement on plastic waste convene for a second session this spring, the European Union will bring evidence that it practices what it preaches.</p><p>In November, the European Commission proposed sweeping packaging regulations that would require companies selling products in EU countries to make their packaging easier to reuse, recycle or in some cases, compost. Takeaway food, hot and cold drinks, wine and other alcohol would have to be provided at least partly in reusable packaging by 2030, and the rules would limit unnecessary empty space in packaging. The EU’s overall goal: to reduce packaging waste by 5% by 2030, compared to 2018 levels, and by 15% by 2040.</p><p>Many of these policies can also be found in proposals submitted by the EU ahead of the May U.N. session on plastic waste: minimums on recycled content and reusable packaging, limits on the use of labels claiming biodegradability, and “eco-design” criteria that includes avoiding empty space and promoting durable and refillable packaging. Those objectives also largely reflect the views of the U.N. negotiations’ “High Ambition Coalition,” a group of countries including EU member states and the U.K., Ghana, Senegal, Australia and Canada. The small island states most negatively impacted by marine plastic waste are also calling for better design and reuse.</p><p>This could be due to a conflict with your ad-blocking or security software.</p><p>Please add <strong>japantimes.co.jp</strong> and <strong>piano.io</strong> to your list of allowed sites. </p><p>If this does not resolve the issue or you are unable to add the domains to your allowlist, please see <a href=""https://support.japantimes.co.jp/hc/en-us/articles/12513310460825"" target=""_blank"">this FAQ</a>. </p><p>We humbly apologize for the inconvenience.</p><p>In a time of both misinformation and too much information,<span class=""pc-line-break""></span> quality journalism is more crucial than ever.<br>By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.</p><p>With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

If someone’s heart stopped because of cardiac arrest, that person fell to the ground, with no pulse, no breathing. And they were simply declared dead.</p><p>All of that changed when doctors at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore discovered cardiopulmonary resuscitation by accident when studying how to shock a heart. When they pressed defibrillator panels to the chest of a lab dog, they saw a blip in blood pressure. They pressed harder and discovered they could push blood through the body. And thus was born CPR.</p><p>The problem is that only a tiny fraction of people who experience cardiac arrest and are not at a hospital get CPR. That, said Dr. Benjamin Abella, medical director of the Center for Resuscitation Science at the University of Pennsylvania, is “a national tragedy.” Bystander CPR can be the difference between life and death, as the case of Damar Hamlin demonstrated during a Buffalo Bills-Cincinnati Bengals football game in January.</p><p>This could be due to a conflict with your ad-blocking or security software.</p><p>Please add <strong>japantimes.co.jp</strong> and <strong>piano.io</strong> to your list of allowed sites. </p><p>If this does not resolve the issue or you are unable to add the domains to your allowlist, please see <a href=""https://support.japantimes.co.jp/hc/en-us/articles/12513310460825"" target=""_blank"">this FAQ</a>. </p><p>We humbly apologize for the inconvenience.</p><p>In a time of both misinformation and too much information,<span class=""pc-line-break""></span> quality journalism is more crucial than ever.<br>By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.</p><p>With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

2023-02-24T16:21:20+09:00,Daniel Flatley,How Biden’s shock-and-awe tactic is failing to stop Russia,"<p>National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan’s West Wing office was crammed with sleep-deprived staffers on the morning of Feb. 26, 2022. Clad in jeans and button-down shirts, clutching coffees or cold pizza, they were waiting for U.S. President Joe Biden to join on a secure line. Russia had invaded Ukraine two days earlier. The burning question of the day: How to stop a war.</p><p>The U.S. had been warning of a looming invasion for weeks. Sullivan’s team had a plan, one they’d kept closely held out of fear it would be discovered by Russian intelligence. It involved freezing some $300 billion of Russian central bank assets held abroad. That would generate enough shock and awe, the authors figured, to bring Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war to a halt — or at the very least, severely hamper his ability to fight it.</p><p>The measure, seen at the time as the economic equivalent of a nuclear weapon, was announced at 5 p.m. in Washington that Saturday. In the days that followed, as Russia’s currency tanked, prices soared, and people lined up at banks to pull out whatever cash they could, some Biden aides briefly worried that they’d gone too far. They didn’t want to completely crater the Russian economy, out of fear the damage would spread to Europe and beyond.</p><p>This could be due to a conflict with your ad-blocking or security software.</p><p>Please add <strong>japantimes.co.jp</strong> and <strong>piano.io</strong> to your list of allowed sites. </p><p>If this does not resolve the issue or you are unable to add the domains to your allowlist, please see <a href=""https://support.japantimes.co.jp/hc/en-us/articles/12513310460825"" target=""_blank"">this FAQ</a>. </p><p>We humbly apologize for the inconvenience.</p><p>In a time of both misinformation and too much information,<span class=""pc-line-break""></span> quality journalism is more crucial than ever.<br>By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.</p><p>With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

It’s been the unprecedented speed of an energy transition that in one year has nearly eliminated its dependence on Russian fossil fuels in an attempt to strangle the key source of funding for Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war machine.</p><p>The shift has been far from the kind of climate-first transition that Europe has envisioned for its long-term future, with governments paying whatever it takes to secure liquefied sources of natural gas brought in by ships, burning more coal and ripping up some environmental plans in the process. And it’s been painful, with Europe getting hit by a roughly $1 trillion energy bill last year, cushioned by hundreds of billions of euros of government subsidies.</p><p>Still, even the most optimistic outlooks from analysts and the bloc’s own leaders at the outset of the war failed to predict how quickly Europe could move. A year ago, Europe spent about $1 billion a day to pay for gas, oil, and coal imported from Russia. Today, it pays a small fraction of that amount.</p><p>This could be due to a conflict with your ad-blocking or security software.</p><p>Please add <strong>japantimes.co.jp</strong> and <strong>piano.io</strong> to your list of allowed sites. </p><p>If this does not resolve the issue or you are unable to add the domains to your allowlist, please see <a href=""https://support.japantimes.co.jp/hc/en-us/articles/12513310460825"" target=""_blank"">this FAQ</a>. </p><p>We humbly apologize for the inconvenience.</p><p>In a time of both misinformation and too much information,<span class=""pc-line-break""></span> quality journalism is more crucial than ever.<br>By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.</p><p>With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

Spain’s Minister for Environmental Transition, Teresa Ribera, called it ""an occupation without a license and therefore, illegal.”</p><p>Just 50 kilometers north of Madrid, Navacerrada is a small but iconic spot held dear by the hundreds of thousands of Spaniards — including the country’s most famous Olympic skiing champions — who have touched snow on its slopes. It sits at the heart of a fraught dispute between authorities that want to turn it into a national park and locals who see it as a major source of income.
